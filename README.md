These are 6 simple projects in GNS3.

GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to
emulate, model, test and troubleshoot virtual and real-world
networks. GNS3 allows you to run a small topology consisting of only a few
devices on your laptop, or many devices hosted on multiple
servers or even hosted in the cloud.

GNS3 does emulation not simulation, emulates terminal devices and provides the interface
(command line) to execute the same commands that would be executed in the real world.
