These are 6 simple projects in GNS3, using VMware Workstation 17 Player.

There is a topology and in the end a script is run to check if it satisfies the 
questions asked.

There is a "Link" file which contains the link to GNS3 portable projects in Google Drive.

GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to
emulate, model, test and troubleshoot virtual and real-world
networks. GNS3 allows you to run a small topology consisting of only a few
devices on your laptop, or many devices hosted on multiple
servers or even hosted in the cloud.

GNS3 does emulation not simulation, emulates terminal devices and provides the interface
(command line) to execute the same commands that would be executed in the real world.
terminal device.

VMware Workstation 17 Player is a desktop virtualization software that allows you to run 
multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine. It provides a 
virtualized environment where you can create, configure, and run virtual machines (VMs).

Combined with GNS3, you can simulate complex network topologies by connecting virtual 
machines to network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. This setup allows for 
realistic testing of network configurations.
