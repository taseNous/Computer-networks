# Computer-networks

<b> Project Structure

- We are asked to implement a topology, following some simple commands. 
- There are questions based on the commands we gave.
- We run a script to check if the questions are answered correctly.

1. A simple introduction to GNS3 and how to build a basic topology using a SWITCH and terminals. We also learn to connect it with VMware.
2. We continue the intriduction building a network topology using Routers and NAT.
3. Introduction to MIKROTIK ROUTER.
4. Basic configuration for accessing CISCO ROUTER.
5. Implementation of backbone networks with a MIKROTIK ROUTER and their interconnection with the BGP Protocol.
6. Introduction to VLAN use - VLAN Trunking

GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to
emulate, model, test and troubleshoot virtual and real-world
networks. GNS3 allows you to run a small topology consisting of only a few
devices on your laptop, or many devices hosted on multiple
servers or even hosted in the cloud.

GNS3 does emulation not simulation, emulates terminal devices and provides the interface
(command line) to execute the same commands that would be executed in the real world.
terminal device.

GNS3 is open source software, free of charge, which can be downloaded from: https://www.gns3.com

VMware Workstation 17 Player is a desktop virtualization software that allows you to run 
multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical machine. It provides a 
virtualized environment where you can create, configure, and run virtual machines (VMs).

Combined with GNS3, you can simulate complex network topologies by connecting virtual 
machines to network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. This setup allows for 
realistic testing of network configurations.

VMware is a program for creating and managing virtual machines. It can be downloaded from: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html
